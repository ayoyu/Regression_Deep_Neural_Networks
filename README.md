Prediction Boston House price with Deep Neural Networks 


In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a Deep Neural networks with 3 layers
that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts.

A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about 
a home â€” in particular, its monetary value.

utility : This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use 
of such information on a daily basis.

The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 13 features 
for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts.

The Boston Housing Dataset consists of price of houses in various places in Boston. Alongside with price
the dataset also provide information such as Crime (CRIM), areas of non-retail business in the town (INDUS),the age of people 
who own the house (AGE), and there are many other attributes that available here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.names
